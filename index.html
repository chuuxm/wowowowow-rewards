    <h1>THE WOWOWOWOW AWARDS</h1>

        <h2>Best LOONA Member</h2>
        <p>(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Chuu is by far one of my favorite members! I originally thought her voice in her "Heart Attack" was absolutely stunning. And she's either directly or indirectly given lesbians visibility through the production of her music video. I find her absolutely adorable and the vibes she gives off are never short of warm and alluring. ♥</p>

        <h2>Best Solo Track</h2>
        <p>(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Jinsoul's "Singing In The Rain" solo is one of the top tracks from any LOONA member. I love this song the most because it's a love song, but it isn't very upbeat. It has a very sly undertone to it, and the music video itself is so visually pleasing. ♥</p>

        <h2>Best SubUnit</h2>
        <p>(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ "love4eva" is arguably the cutest song anyone could even think about producing. Besides Chuu being in this subunit, love4eva surrounded the concept and idea of love from one person to another, and the soft vocals within the song were to die for. ♥</p>

        <h2>Best Duo</h2>
        <p>(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Heart Attack by Chuu is the most upbeat love song to even be created within the group, and it's my favorite because the lyrics mention how much she loves Yves and how she believes their connection to be destiny. Throughout the music video, Chuu continues expressing her love for the other girl and she eventually gives her soul to Yves - who doesn't seem to exist after Chuu dies. The theories for this MV were complex, but the explanation for that can be explained some other time. ♥</p>
